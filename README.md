# @metamask/template-snap-monorepo

---

This repository demonstrates how to develop a snap with TypeScript. For detailed instructions,
see [the MetaMask Snaps quickstart documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/quickstart).

MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely expand the capabilities
of MetaMask. A _snap_ is a program that we run in an isolated environment that
can customize the wallet experience.

## Snaps is pre-release software

To interact with (your) Snaps, you will need to install [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/),
a canary distribution for developers that provides access to upcoming features.

## Getting Started

To use this template, create a new snap project using the command line:

```sh
yarn create @metamask/snap your-snap-name
# or...
npm create @metamask/snap your-snap-name
```

For further instructions, consult [the MetaMask Snaps quickstart documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/quickstart).

## Contributing

### Testing and Linting

Run `yarn test` to run the tests once.

Run `yarn lint` to run the linter, or run `yarn lint:fix` to run the linter and
fix any automatically fixable issues.

### Using NPM packages with scripts

Scripts are disabled by default for security reasons. If you need to use NPM
packages with scripts, you can run `yarn allow-scripts auto`, and enable the
script in the `lavamoat.allowScripts` section of `package.json`.

See the documentation for [@lavamoat/allow-scripts](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/tree/main/packages/allow-scripts)
for more information.
